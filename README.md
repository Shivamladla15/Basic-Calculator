Below is a sample README.md file for a basic calculator project. It assumes you're creating a simple calculator (e.g., a command-line or web-based tool) that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If you have a specific programming language or platform in mind (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or a web app), let me know, and I can tailor it further!
